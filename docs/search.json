We produced this analysis in two programming languages: R and Python. This project helped bolster my skills in both R and Python, allowing me to see the strengths and weaknesses of both languages in the context of machine learning, data visualization, and data summary.\n\nPythonR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy data science senior capstone project at Cal Poly was to create a network analysis framework for the Global Emancipation Network to help combat human trafficking by identifying criminal networks in the illicit massage business industry. I worked on an interdisciplinary team with three other data science students: Bella White, Thea Yang, and Amara Zabback. The project took course over a 6 month period that consisted of comprehensive network planning and design, data collection from various publicly available sources, self-teaching of a graph database and visualization software (Neo4j), and an interactive network implementation.\nFor a comprehensive summary of the work we completed, please refer to the formal report we created below:\n\n\n\nThis project has a few components:\n\nDevelop an automated way to keep score in the game ‘Oh Hell’\nCreate a database to store player statistics\nCreate an AI capable of playing ‘Oh Hell’ at a competent level\n\nThus far, I have only achieved the first of these goals, but I plan to continue work in the near future."

    "text": "USCOTS 2023ISI-BUDS\n\n\n\nBackground\nIn late May/early June of 2023, I attended the United States Conference Of Teaching Statistics in State College, Pennsylvania along with several peers and professors from Cal Poly. USCOTS is a conference that consists of a myriad of workshops, each presented by professors from universities across the United States (and a few from abroad!). There were also various presentations and opportunities to discuss with colleagues interested in similar areas relating to statistics and statistics education. The theme of USCOTS 2023 was communicating with and about data.\n\n\nDay One\nOn day one, I helped facilitate a workshop run by three Cal Poly professors: Dr. Glanz, Dr. Theobold, and Dr. Robinson by live testing questions from participants and assisting with participants’ issues as they arose.\n\n\n\nFrom left to right: Emily Robinson, Allison Theobold, Sean Leader, Hunter Glanz\n\n\nThe workshop covered Quarto, a versatile tool that allows users to create reproducible documents that integrate both code and text together. As a matter of fact, my website is built entirely in Quarto. We focused on using Quarto as a classroom resource - not only as a way for professors to create course materials such as presentations or websites, but also as a way for students to create reproducible documents for class assignments.\n\n\nDay Two\nOn day two, I attended two workshops, each of which focused on improving student learning outcomes using nontraditional methodologies.\n\nImproving students’ communication about data using online statistical games\nThis workshop provided a handful of games meant to teach statistical concepts through the lens of games that engage students in the learning process. We played two games.\n\nA crop-growing game that teaches students about random variation, blocking, and linear modelling.\nA racing game that teaches students about outliers, paired data, and confounding.\n\nIf you’re interesting in exploring any of these games, please check out their resources here: https://www.stat2games.sites.grinnell.edu\n\n\nCommunicating progress in a statistics course through non-traditional grading\nThis workshop discussed non-traditional grading schemes that focus on qualitative grading schemes that de-emphasize numeric scores on particular assignments or exams, and instead focus on giving comprehensive feedback and allowing students to resubmit assignments multiple times. I think this grading scheme is particularly interesting, especially in the era of generative AI, as traditional grading methods may be more susceptible to abuse by students using services such as ChatGPT or Google Bard.\n\n\n\nDay Three / Four\nDays Three and Four consisted of a mixture of a few types of events:\n\nKeynote Presentations\nIn keynote presentations at USCOTS 2023, one speaker presented to the entirety of the conference attendees. These presentations focused heavily on the conference theme, providing a diverse set of perspectives on how statisticians and data scientists can enhance their communication skills with and about data. My favorite of the keynotes was Larry Lesser’s presentation on ‘edutainment’, a teaching paradigm that treats students’ entertainment, well-being, and engagement as paramount.\n\n\nBreakout Sessions\nBreakout sessions were short, fast-paced dialogues between presenters and attendees. During a given time slot, there were about 10 different breakout sessions one could attend based on their interests. Here are a few highlight sessions I attended:\n\nData Science as a general education course\n\nIn this session hosted by Hunter Glanz, we conversed about data science as a terminal (not meant to lead into another course) general education course, where we discussed how to introduce topics about data science to a general audience. Given that data science is a complex and nuanced subject often taught after prerequisite courses, it is not obvious which topics deserve coverage in terminal course that may be taught to anyone, STEM or non-STEM. Dr. Glanz will be releasing a book by the name ‘Data For All’ (which I will contribute to during my graduate studies!) that is meant to do exactly this, so be on the lookout!\n\nWhat makes a compelling visualization?\n\nThis meeting hosted by Beth Chance and Emily Robinson discussed how to create informative and communicative visualizations, touching on both what to do as well as what not to do. This session sparked a great dialogue which gave me further insight on how to make compelling visuals at both an introductory and advanced level.\n\n\n\n\nPoster Talks\nDuring poster talks, dozens of participants presented their novel research on countless topics, ranging from phone apps meant to teach statistics to research on medieval-era data. In these talks, I was able to converse one-on-one with the various participants and ask (too many) questions about what they had done. My personal favorite of these posters taught students to compare traditional statistical modelling methodologies to some contemporary algorithmic techniques.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis was the first conference I have ever attended. Although I would say I experienced a bit of information overload, I would not trade the experience for anything. I met many wonderful individuals and was welcomed with open arms to the statistics education community. I especially appreciated that although 99% (forgive my lackadaisical estimation) of attendees either had or were pursuing their PhDs, I was treated as an equal. Thank you to the organizers, presenters, sponsors, and attendees for providing me with a truly unforgettable experience.\n\n\n\n\nBackground\nISI-BUDS is a summer undergraduate research program I am participating in during summer 2023. I will be updating this post with details as I experience!"
