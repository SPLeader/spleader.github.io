## USCOTS 2023

### Background

In late May/early June of 2023, I attended [the United States Conference Of Teaching Statistics](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots) in State College, Pennsylvania along with several peers and professors from Cal Poly. USCOTS is a conference that consists of a myriad of workshops, each presented by professors from universities across the United States (and a few from abroad!). There were also various presentations and opportunities to discuss with colleagues interested in similar areas relating to statistics and statistics education. **The theme of USCOTS 2023 was communicating with and about data.**

### Day One

On day one, I helped facilitate a workshop run by three Cal Poly professors: [Dr. Glanz](https://statistics.calpoly.edu/hunter-glanz), [Dr. Theobold](https://statistics.calpoly.edu/allison-theobold), and [Dr. Robinson](https://statistics.calpoly.edu/Emily-Robinson) by live testing questions from participants and assisting with participants' issues as they arose.

The workshop covered [Quarto](https://quarto.org), a versatile tool that allows users to create reproducible documents that integrate both code and text together. As a matter of fact, my website is built entirely in Quarto. We focused on using Quarto as a classroom resource - not only as a way for professors to create course materials such as presentations or websites, but also as a way for students to create reproducible documents for class assignments.

### Day Two

On day two, I attended two workshops, each of which focused on improving student learning outcomes using nontraditional methodologies.

#### Improving students' communication about data using online statistical games

This workshop provided a handful of games meant to teach statistical concepts through the lens of games that engage students in the learning process. We played two games.

-   A crop-growing game that teaches students about random variation, blocking, and linear modelling.

-   A racing game that teaches students about outliers, paired data, and confounding.

If you're interesting in exploring any of these games, please check out their resources here: <https://www.stat2games.sites.grinnell.edu>

#### Communicating progress in a statistics course through non-traditional grading

This workshop discussed non-traditional grading schemes that focus on qualitative grading schemes that de-emphasize numeric scores on particular assignments or exams, and instead focus on giving comprehensive feedback and allowing students to resubmit assignments multiple times. I think this grading scheme is particularly interesting, especially in the era of generative AI, as traditional grading methods may be more susceptible to abuse by students using services such as ChatGPT or Google Bard.

### Day Three / Four

Days Three and Four consisted of a mixture of a few types of events:

#### Keynote Presentations

In keynote presentations at USCOTS 2023, one speaker presented to the entirety of the conference attendees. These presentations focused heavily on the conference theme, providing a diverse set of perspectives on how statisticians and data scientists can enhance their communication skills with and about data. My favorite of the keynotes was [Larry Lesser's](https://larrylesser.com/welcome-to-statistics-education) presentation on 'edutainment', a teaching paradigm that treats students' entertainment, well-being, and engagement as paramount.

#### Breakout Sessions

Breakout sessions were short, fast-paced dialogues between presenters and attendees. During a given time slot, there were about 10 different breakout sessions one could attend based on their interests. Here are a few highlight sessions I attended:

-   Data Science as a general education course
    -    In this session hosted by Hunter Glanz, we conversed about data science as a terminal (not meant to lead into another course) general education course, where we discussed how to introduce topics about data science to a general audience. Given that data science is a complex and nuanced subject often taught after prerequisite courses, it is not obvious which topics deserve coverage in terminal course that may be taught to anyone, STEM or non-STEM. Dr. Glanz will be releasing a book by the name 'Data For All' (which I will contribute to during my graduate studies!) that is meant to do exactly this, so be on the lookout!  
    
- What makes a compelling visualization?
  - This meeting hosted by Beth Chance and Emily Robinson discussed how to create informative and communicative visualizations, touching on both what *to* do as well as what *not* to do. This session sparked a great dialogue which gave me further insight on how to make compelling visuals at both an introductory and advanced level.
  
#### Poster Talks

During poster talks, dozens of participants presented their novel research on countless topics, ranging from phone apps meant to teach statistics to research on medieval-era data. In these talks, I was able to converse one-on-one with the various participants and ask (too many) questions about what they had done. My personal favorite of these posters taught students to compare traditional statistical modelling methodologies to some contemporary algorithmic techniques.

### Conclusion

This was the first conference I have ever attended. Although I would say I experienced a bit of information overload, I would not trade the experience for anything. I met many wonderful individuals and was welcomed with open arms to the statistics education community. I especially appreciated that although 99% (forgive my lackadaisical estimation) of attendees either had or were pursuing their PhDs, I was treated as an equal. Thank you to the organizers, presenters, sponsors, and attendees for providing me with a truly unforgettable experience.
