I am a graduate student at Cal Poly, SLO studying Statistics and Data Science. I love using my domain knowledge and computational skills to better understand the world around me, in both a personal and professional context. I will be graduating in June 2024 with my Master's degree in Statistics and am actively looking for work after my graduation.
