We produced this analysis in two programming languages: R and Python. This project helped bolster my skills in both R and Python, allowing me to see the strengths and weaknesses of both languages in the context of machine learning, data visualization, and data summary.\n\nPythonR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project has a few components:\n\nDevelop an automated way to keep score in the game ‘Oh Hell’\nCreate a database to store player statistics\nCreate an AI capable of playing ‘Oh Hell’ at a competent level\n\nThus far, I have only achieved the first of these goals, but I plan to continue work in the near future."
